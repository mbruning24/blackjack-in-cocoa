Source Code for BlackJack in Cocoa (Snow Leopard, I think...)

I created this repo to share the source code of my simple blackjack game in Cocoa. It was built on Snow Leopard, and I haven't tested it for about a year now. Not sure if it still works, but the .h and .m files are still readable, right? Right.

The cards directory will need to be copied to the parent folder as that's where they're linked. I'm not sure if it's a relative or absolute link, so If the images don't work if you pull this into Xcode, try relinking the image files.

Cheers.
